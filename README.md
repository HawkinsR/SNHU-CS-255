# Project: DriverPass System Design

## Project Summary
The DriverPass system is an all in one portal for customers of DriverPass to schedule driving lessons and participate in online classroom learning, with practice tests and review material. The system connects scheduled lessons with instructors and cars, and allows for staff and customers alike to manage the bookings.

## Project Reflection

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe I was particularly effective in translating the client's business requirements into a clear project definition. For instance, the requirement to reseet a users password automatically was carried through from client interview through to final documentation. This design directly supports the system's core function while remaining scalable and offering future expansion without much trouble.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part, it would be the initial set of UML Use Case diagrams. While they covered the main functionalities, I think they were too high-level, especially regarding the "Secretary" actor.

I would improve this by creating more granular, detailed use cases for administrative functions. This would have provided a clearer roadmap for development and help identify potential edge cases earlier in the design phase.

### How did you interpret the userâ€™s needs and implement them into your system design?

I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on the key "jobs" each user type had to perform. For example, the "Customer" user's primary need was "schedule a lesson." For the "Owner," the need was "gather data and run reports." While different features, identifying them and ensuring that they are added to the system design hinged on recognizing that each is a core functionality of the actor.

This user-centric approach is critical because a system is only successful if it's adopted and used. If the design doesn't intuitively solve the user's specific problem, they will revert to old methods (like calling the office), and the system will fail to deliver its intended business value.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach is to start with the "why" before the "what" or "how." I first seek to understand the core business problem the software is intended to solve. From there, I identify the key users (actors) and their primary goals. I then map out the high-level data flow and user interactions before drilling down into specific technical details like database tables or API endpoints.
